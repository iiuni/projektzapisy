    a client may cause a report to be sent. Sending more requests during this period does not
    prolong it; only the time of the last request passed to Rollbar is used. This class does not
    communicate with the Rollbar's servers. Any first request from a client in a timeframe will be
    simply passed to the official middleware provided by the Rollbar project. In any case, the user
    will see the error page and their client should receive 404 error code. Any action
    performed by this middleware should not be deduced by a client.
